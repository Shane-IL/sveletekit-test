<h1>About</h1>
<p>
	This is a small personal project for me to get acquinted with SvelteKit<br />It will use some open
	APIs to display data about space rockets. I recently made a large webapp for work using NextJS and
	at the same time started to get into Svelte and quite liked the concept of SvelteKit so here we
	go.
